# Additional Book Materials

You can see the introduction plus the first three chapters here. Some of the code examples in the chapters require additional materials to run. I have placed them here in this repository.

## Chapter 3

These are examples I used as inputs to OpenAI and Anthropic to show how you can pass in files to interpret.

 - Raleigh search and seizures document, saved as `RaleighSearchSeizure.pdf`, downloaded from <https://public.powerdms.com/RPD1/tree/documents/866204> on 12/5/2025
 - Monthly robberies in Chicago chart, `MonthlyRobberiesChicago.png`, see my crimepy python library for how this was generated, <https://github.com/apwheele/crimepy/blob/main/notebooks/TimeSeriesCharts.ipynb>
 - Audio file, `WebMapAudio11sec.mp3`, first 11 seconds from this Youtube video I made, <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBm6sTR08BI&t=35s>, on describing the cartographic decisions I made around an interactive hotspot map.

## Chapter 5

These are examples I used in Chapter 5, RAG. Documents downloaded on 12/7/2025.

 - Raleigh policy documents, via <https://public.powerdms.com/RPD1/tree>
   - 865833.pdf, Use of Force and Weapons

For the scanned document, I printing out Interacting with Vulnerable Populations (866145.pdf), and then scanned it back in to demonstrate OCR'ing the document.

## Chapter 6

I use example data from Dallas. You can see the script to download this data from the Dallas open data site at <https://github.com/apwheele/apwheele/blob/main/dallas_data.py>. This data was downloaded in a github action on 12/7/2025.
