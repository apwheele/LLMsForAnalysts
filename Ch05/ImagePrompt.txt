The diagram at the start of the chapter, I generated that using Nano banana (using a custom MCP server I created). Here is the initial prompt to Claude code I made

create gemimg image showing two dimensional embedding vector latte and milk (top right unit square) vs traffic accident (lower middle). Cosine is angles and L2 is euclidean distance. 

And here is the prompt Claude code generated to create the image

Educational diagram showing a 2D coordinate system with embedding vectors. Clean minimalist style on white
background. X and Y axes with unit scale marks. Three labeled points with vectors from origin: \"latte\" and \"milk\" as
points close together in the upper right quadrant (around 0.8, 0.9 and 0.7, 0.85), and \"traffic accident\" as a point in the
 lower middle area (around 0.5, 0.2). Draw dotted arc showing the angle between vectors to illustrate \"cosine similarity\".
Draw a straight dashed line between \"milk\" and \"traffic accident\" labeled \"L2 distance\". Include small legend: \"Cosine
 = angle between vectors\" and \"L2 = Euclidean distance\". Technical illustration style, clear labels, no decorations.
